# PillarBabysitterKata2-
Upon completion of the Babysitter coding kata I have realized that creating test cases before your code is actually written, 
is much more efficient than trying to just write your code. Having to write a test case before your actual algorithm allows
you to think thoroughly about the algorithm you are about to write. You also have to think about how the code will break
or not complie correctly before writing your first line of code. With all of that in the back of my mind, I thought out my code
much more than I would have before using TDD.

1.In order to to run my project you must clone the repository into an accessible location on your device.

2.Then you would need to import the gradle project into your editor.

3.After importing the gradle project into your editor you will be able to run the Junit tests I have written.

4.If you need to write your own test cases you can use the setters from the babysitter object to set the family, start time, 
end time, special schedule time. early rate, late rate, and special rate. 

5.Based on your input in the setters the total should be calculated based on the family chosen.
